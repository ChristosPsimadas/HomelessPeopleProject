            During our commute to school or work, there is always a homeless man sleeping on the
            train seats or on the sidewalk. It is a sad sight to see. People who have lost everything
            and now resort to living on the streets. The government does little to help these people.
            We are here to fix this problem and turn the homeless people into Home-More people.
       </p>

       <h3>How many homeless people are?</h3>
       
       <p>
            In a city of more than 8.3 million people, nearly one 
            in every 106 New Yorkers is homeless â€” that's nearly 70,000 men, women and children. 
            An estimated 3,400 people are living unsheltered in the subways, on the streets of Manhattan,
            or in one of the other boroughs.

        <h3>Why we should help</h3>

        <p>
            Even though these people are homeless now, they were not always homeless. They might've been homeless 
            due to death of their caretakers, laid off of their job, or they were orphaned. What we are trying to 
            say is that most homeless people experienced a series of unfortunate events which led to where they are 
            now. They haven't gotten the opportunity to turn their lives around, but we are here to give them that 
            opportunity many seek. By giving them housing, they don't have to worry about freezing during the winter 
            or the overwhelming heat of the summer. Giving them housing could allow them to seek out jobs and finally
            turn their lives around.
