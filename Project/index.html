        <h1>Home More People</h1>
        <p>During our commute to school or work, there is always a homeless man sleeping on the
            train seats or on the sidewalk. It is a sad sight to see. People who have lost everything
            and now resorts to living on the streets. The government does little to help these people.
            We are here to fix this problem and turn the homeless people into Home-More people.
