            During our commute to school or work, there is always a homeless man sleeping on the
            train seats or on the sidewalk. It is a sad sight to see. People who have lost everything
            and now resort to living on the streets. The government does little to help these people.
            We are here to fix this problem and turn the homeless people into Home-More people.

       <h3>How many homeless people are?</h3>

       <p>
            In a city of more than 8.3 million people, nearly one 
            in every 106 New Yorkers is homeless â€” that's nearly 70,000 men, women and children. 
            An estimated 3,400 people are living unsheltered in the subways, on the streets of Manhattan,
            or in one of the other boroughs.
