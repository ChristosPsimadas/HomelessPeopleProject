        <h1>Our Goal</h1>
        <p>
            Our goal is to remove all homeless people from the streets of New York City and relocate 
            them to a better environment. We have many possible solutions to help us solve this issue.
            
            <h3>Solution 1</h3>
            Many New York City apartments are left vacant and empty. The only purpose of these apartments 
            is for the rich to avoid taxes and collect dust. We purpose to buy or legally obtain these apartments 
            inorder to redistrubite them to the homeless. This would help the homeless have shelter and allow them 
            to seek jobs or other forms of employment to get them back on their feet.
            
            <h3>Solution 2</h3>
            We could create tiny houses or small homes in areas where there is empty land like abandoned parking 
            lots or buildings. We could tear those buildings down and replace the land with small homes to get the 
            homeless off the streets. Land like that will most likely never be used again so we can find a use for it 
            by reusing the land.
