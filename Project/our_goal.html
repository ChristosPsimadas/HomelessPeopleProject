        <h1>Our Goal</h1>
        <p>
            Our goal is to remove all homeless people from the streets of New York City and relocate 
            them to a better environment. Many New York City apartments are left vacant and empty. The 
            only purpose of these apartments is for the rich to avoid taxes and collect dust. We purpose 
            to buy or legally obtain these apartments inorder to redistrubite them to the homeless.
